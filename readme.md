The website at [https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ericoc/ticks/](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ericoc/ticks/)
hosts microscopic images taken of ticks using
the [_Quanta 600 FEG Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM)_](https://www.nano.upenn.edu/equipment/quanta-600-feg-esem/).

These ticks were gathered in late May 2025.
